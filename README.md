# screenshots.py

### About

Takes a screenshot of a Tumblr post, given a URL.

As of right now, this tool cannot take screenshots of mature posts, though this is currently being worked on.

Also fails on blogs requiring a login.

### Dependencies

(Note that it may work with older versions; these were just the ones I used.)

- playwright (>=1.57.0)
- oauthlib (>=3.3.1)
- aiohttp (>=3.13.2)
